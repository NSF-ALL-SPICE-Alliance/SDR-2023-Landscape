# Introduction

Welcome to R! We'll go over some brief introductory information on how to get started programming in R and R Studio, exploratory data analysis, and helpful coding resources. 

# Starter Information **DOUBLE CHECK**

To follow along with this lesson, you should have an R Script (OR R MARKDOWN??, or TEMPLATE??) open. 

## Packages and Libraries
One of the most helpful tools to an R programmer are R packages! In a nutshell, an R package is a toolbox that can have a variety of things that can be useful to you (datasets, functions, etc.). Packages are stored in a *library* in R. You already have some R packages installed - let's run some code to see which packages you have. 

```{r}
library()
```

A new window should have opened up with a list of packages and a short description! 

### Installing a Package

Let's say you want to start using the tidyverse package to make cool visualizations, but haven't installed it yet. Run the following code in the console to install it:

Note: it's very important to follow the coding syntax (make sure the package name is in quotes within the parentheses). Also, remove the hashtag when running this line of code. 

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse") 
```

Let's double check to see if it installed correctly using the following code:

```{r}
system.file(package = "tidyverse") # input the name of the package in quotes
```

If you got a response giving you a file path - you're all set! You successfully installed your first package! 

### Loading a Library

To be able to use the package and its functions in R Studio, we need to load the library (a library is where the package is stored). Run the following code to load the tidyverse library in your R session:

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # put the name of the package/library in the parenthesis 
```
Awesome! Now we can access the many cool things that the tidyverse package can do for us. We'll start using this package and its functions as we go along.

## Variables

In order to easily access datasets and values, we need to store them somewhere! That's what variables are for - variables are containers for storing data values. Here are some basic rules for creating variables:

1. They are created by using the <- or = sign. 
2. The coding syntax depends on what type of data value you are trying to store:
  a. Character strings are stored within quotations.
  b. Numeric values are not surrounded by any symbols (unless you are trying to create a series of numbers).

Let's practice creating some variables:

1. my_name
```{r}
my_name <- "John Doe" # character strings are stored within quotations
my_name # run the name of your variable to see the output
```

2. my_age
```{r}
my_age = 20 # numeric values do not need any quotations
my_age # run the name of your variable to see the output
```


### Different Types of Data

Understanding the different types of data is crucial when building out your visualizations and throughout the data analysis process. It is super useful when trying to figure out what graph to use or what story you're trying to tell through your data.

#### Qualitative vs. Quantitative

The main two types of data are qualitative and quantitative:

- Qualitative data is categorical data, or an easier way to remember this is any values that are in words or letters. Common examples include gender, home town, etc. Sometimes, qualitative data can be presented as a numeric, but still have categorical/qualitative value (for example, postal codes).

- Quantitative data is numerical data and is represented by numbers. There are two types of quantitative data:
  - Discrete data is FINITE, or in other words, only whole numbers. For example, the number of students taking this course.
  - Continuous data is INFINITE, or in other words, can be decimal points and is almost impossible to count. For example, temperature ranges and time intervals.
  
Note: in most common and basic plots, discrete variables are used for the x-axis and continuous variables are used for the y-axis.

#### R Data Types

There are different data types in R:

- character (also known as strings; "a", "cat")
- numeric (1, 25.2)
- integer (numeric data without decimals)
- logical (also known as Boolean; TRUE or FALSE)
- complex (9 + 2i, where "i" is an imaginary number)

To put this into perspective with our knowledge on qualitative and quantitative data:

In most cases, characters and logical R data types are considered qualitative data. Numeric, integer, and complex are mostly considered quantitative data.

### Removing Variables

If you want to remove or delete a variable, you can run the following code:

```{r}
rm(my_name) # input the variable name in the parenthesis
```

### Variables Best Practices
#### Naming Variables

It's important to name your variables wisely. Here are some naming recommendations:

- Variables can start with letters or dot characters (for ex. .var or var)
- It should NOT start with numbers or an underscore
- The only symbols that are allowed in variable names are . and _ (no $,%,& allowed)
- It should NOT be a reserved keyword in R (see this [link](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/reserved-words) for a list of reserved keywords)

#### Creating New Variables

After you read in your dataset and assign it to a variable (which we're going to do in a bit), the next step is to manipulate, clean, and subset your data. As you start to play around with your data, it's recommended to assign the clean or modified version of your data to a new variable. 

In other words, it's good practice to keep your original dataset in the event you need to refer to it in the future.

## Functions

In the programming world, functions are used to complete tasks quickly and efficiently. They are many built-in functions in different R packages, and we can write functions ourselves! At this point in the lesson, we've already used and called several functions (library, system.file, and rm). In most cases, you'll know you're using a function when you input arguments within a parenthesis (). 

What are arguments? 

When we talk about arguments, we mean the specifications and variables you input within a function. For example, when we did our `libary()` call, the argument or input was the name of the library/package we wanted to load. 

We'll get to some of the most common functions used in the next section, as we'll apply them to our dataset! 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's start looking into a dataset. In data science, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to learn more about different patterns and relationships in our data. Run the following code to import the *SDR 2023* dataset that we'll be performing EDA on:

## Loading Libraries
```{r}
library(here) # allows us to cut out long file paths
```

Note: If you get an error about not having these packages installed, run the install.packages() code we went over previously.

```{r}
SDR_2023_Data <- read_csv("data/SDR-2023-Data.csv") # assigning the dataset to a variable so that we can access it
View(SDR_2023_Data) # viewing the dataset
```


## Understanding Your Data

Understanding what your data looks like is crucial to the data analysis process. Let's run some code to see what our SDR 2023 dataset is telling us:

```{r}
head(SDR_2023_Data) # view the first couple of rows and columns of your dataset
```

As we talked about earlier, it's always helpful to know what types of data you're handling. The code below shows us what type of data type each column holds (for ex., chr = character, num = numeric), the number of rows (you'll see that it's 206:666, meaning 206 rows and 666 columns), and some of the first few values for each column. 

```{r}
data_structure <- str(SDR_2023_Data) # looking at the data structure
```

Wow, that's a lot of information on the dataset structure! Let's run some code to look at some of these aspects closely:

- Viewing column names
```{r}
column_names <- as.list(colnames(SDR_2023_Data))
```

- How many rows and columns
```{r}
dim(SDR_2023_Data)
```

- How many NA values

NA values represent missing values in our data. It's important to know how many NA values are in your data to better understand how to clean and prepare your data for analysis. We'll be storing this information in a variable called `na_values`, and look at the variable in another tab by using the `View` function. 
```{r}
SDR_2023_Data %>% 
  miss_var_summary() %>% 
  arrange(desc(pct_miss))
```

```{r}
na_values <- colSums(is.na(SDR_2023_Data))
na_values %>% 
  arrange(desc(na_values))
```
As you can see, the column *SDG 2023 Index Score* has a total of 27 NA values! 


- Looking at responses for a specific column

Let's say we're interested in looking at the different responses for the column *Goal 7 Dash*. Run the following code to create a table on the types of values and frequency in that column:

```{r}
table(SDR_2023_Data$`Goal 7 Dash`) # after the $ operator, write the name of the column you're interested in exploring
```
Awesome! Let's try to input two columns to explore further: 

```{r}
table(SDR_2023_Data$`Goal 7 Dash`, SDR_2023_Data$`Regions used for the SDR`) # looking at 2 columns, separated by a ,
```
Now you can see how many countries in each region got green, orange, red, and yellow scores for SDG Goal 7. We've also used 8 new functions (View, read_csv, head, dim, etc.). Great job!

## Cleaning and Manipulating Data 

The next step is cleaning and manipulating data. There are different ways to do this, depending on what your goals are and what specific aspects or relationships you're trying to show. We'll be going over some common data cleaning and manipulation functions that are found in the tidyverse package that we've already loaded.


*1. select()*

Select is a function used to subset or select columns in your R data frame. The first *argument* that `select()` takes in is x, or the data. The next argument is the column(s) you want to select. Let's try this out by selecting the SDG 3 and SDG 4 scores.

```{r}
select(SDR_2023_Data, c("Goal 3 Score", "Goal 4 Score"))
```

If you're wondering why we used the letter c and the extra parenthesis, it's because we put it in a vector! When we are listing multiple columns or variables, we store them in a vector. To do this, we put the character `c`, followed by an open parenthesis, your columns/variables (remember what we discussed earlier - if you're typing letters, they need to be in quotes!) separated by commas, and close parenthesis. 

What if we want to subset specific rows? We can do this by using the filter function. 


*2. filter()*

Similarly to select, `filter()` can be used to extract specific rows. Let's try this out by filtering our data for those within the Oceania region.

In order to do this, the first argument filter takes is x, or the dataset, followed by the condition we are filtering for (in this case, we want to filter out all rows that fall under the Oceania region). We write out the column name "Regions used the for SDR" followed by == and then "Oceania". 


```{r}
filter(SDR_2023_Data, `Regions used for the SDR` == "Oceania")
```

Notes: 
- In programming, we don't use spaces in names (usually, if you want to use a space between words, you'd use an underscore, slash, or other punctuation). That's why we used these hashmarks `` to write the column name - this is how R is able to read in the spaces. 

- As we went over earlier, the = sign is used to assign variables. If we want to program the equal sign (for example, 2 = 2), we need to use two equal signs!
  - In the filter example we just did, we are filtering for Regions that are EQUAL to "Oceania", hence the two equal signs. 
  
  
*3. group_by() and summarise()*

Group_by is a great way to view and group a column. This function goes hand-in-hand with another useful function, `summarise()`. Summarise is used to compute summary statistics or aggregate data within each group created by `group_by()`. 

Note: In the following code, we are using the %>% (pipe) operator. This allows us to connect functions within our code so that it performs each step at a time. We start off with our data (SDR_2023_Data), then use the pipe operator to use the group_by() function, and then again to use the summarise() function. 

```{r}
SDR_2023_Data %>% group_by(`Regions used for the SDR`) %>% 
  summarise(goal_7_score = sum(`Population using at least basic drinking water services (%)`))
```


*4. pivot_longer*

Pivot_longer is used to turn wide datasets to a "long" data format, or in other words, reshaping the data. Let's try this out with selecting and looking at Goal 7 indicators. In the following coding example, we'll first start off with our data and a function that we already know, `select()`. Then, we're using the pipe operator to use `pivot_longer` to reshape our data.

In the pivot_longer function, we input the names of the columns to pivot (in this case, it's all the indicator columns we've selected - and don't forget to store it in a vector!), then the name of the *new* column we want the names of the old columns to be stored in (we're naming this new column "Indicator"). 

```{r}
SDR_2023_Data %>% select(c("Country", "Population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking (%)", "CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion per total electricity output (MtCO₂/TWh)","Population with access to electricity (%)","Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%)")) %>%  pivot_longer(cols != "Country", names_to = "Indicator")
```


## Different Types of Graphs

After learning all this information about your data and data manipulation, how do you know what types of graphs to make, and what code to use?

One of the first questions you want to ask yourself is what am I trying to show? Am I looking to compare values, show correlation, distribution, or changes over time?
